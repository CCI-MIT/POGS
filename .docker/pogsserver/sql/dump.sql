spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle). At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior. The emperors permitted free speech, evinced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering retribution. At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, \"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\"',4),(218,'C','2','Fronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils\' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the emperors. Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now ',4),(219,'C','3','perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\" Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.\r\nLucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as his interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to ',4),(220,'C','4','adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors. Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-',4),(221,'C','5','aunt Matilda; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. Marcus\' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.\r\n\r\n',4),(222,'C','6','In the spring of 162, the Tiber flooded over its banks, destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian ',4),(223,'C','7','communities out of the Roman granaries.\r\nOn his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled its king and installed his own Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself. At the time of the invasion, the governor of Syria was L. Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his replacement. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.',4),(224,'C','8','The confidence man Alexander of Abonutichus, a prophet who carried a snake named Glycon around with him, had enraptured Severianus, as he had many others. Father-in-law to the respected senator P. Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, then-proconsul of Asia, Abonutichus was friends with many members of the east Roman elite. ',4),(225,'C','9','Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself. Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past ',4),(226,'C','10','the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.\r\n\r\n',4),(227,'C','11','There was threat of war on other frontiers as well—in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over the limes. Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have ',4),(228,'C','12','given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius\' twenty-three-year reign at his emperor\'s side—and not in the provinces, ',4),(229,'C','13','where most previous emperors had spent their early careers. Marcus made the necessary appointments: Marcus Statius Priscus, the governor of Britain, was sent to replace Severianus as governor of Cappadocia. Sextus Calpurnius Agricola would take Priscus\' former office.\r\nMore bad news arrived: Attidius Cornelianus\' army had been defeated in battle against the Parthians, and retreated ',4),(230,'C','14','in disarray. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), ',4),(231,'C','15','left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions. Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany, II Adiutrix from Aquincum, and V Macedonica from Troesmis. The norther frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible. Attidius Cornelianus himself was replaced by M. Annius Libo, Marcus\' first cousin. He was young his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties and, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.\r\n\r\n',4),(232,'C','16','Marcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: \"What? Do I ',4),(233,'C','17','not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?\" He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling ',4),(234,'C','18','on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy), going so far as to write up a fable about the gods\' division of the day between morning and evening—Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto\'s advice. \"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\" he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto\'s voice to chastise himself: \"\'Much good has my advice done you\', you will say!\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \"—this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\"\r\nFronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, including Cicero\'s pro lege Manilia, in which the orator ',4),(235,'C','19','had argued in favor of Pompey taking supreme command in the Mithridatic War. It was an apt reference (Pompey\'s war had taken him to Armenia), and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front. \"You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels, concerning the choice of army ',4),(236,'C','20','commanders, the interests of allies, the protection of provinces, the discipline of the soldiers, the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere” To settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter, full of historical references. In modern editions of Fronto\'s works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome\'s past, Fronto writes, at Allia, at Caudium, at Cannae, at Numantia, Cirta, and Carrhae; under Trajan, Hadrian, and Pius; but, in the end, Romans had always prevailed over their enemies: \"always and everywhere has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\".\r\n\r\n',4),(237,'C','21','Over the winter of 161-62, as more bad news arrived a rebellion was brewing in Syria it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person. He was stronger and healthier than Marcus, the argument went, more suited to military activity. Lucius\' biographer suggests ulterior motives: to restrain Lucius\' debaucheries, to make him thrifty, to reform his morals by the terror of war, to realize that he was an emperor. Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".\r\nFurius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, M. Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus and M. Iallius Bassus, and part of the praetorian guard. Victorinus had previously served as procurator of Galatia, giving him some experience with eastern affairs. Moreover, he was far more qualified than ',4),(238,'C','22','his praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius\' mistress Galeria Lysistrate. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real access to senatorial circles—his was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the guard, Victorinus was the clear choice.\r\nLaelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and governor of Syria in 153; he hence had first-hand ',4),(239,'C','23','knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made comes Augustorum (\"companion of the emperors\") for his service. Laelianus was, in the words ',4),(240,'C','24','of Fronto, \"a serious man and an old-fashioned disciplinarian\". Bassus had been governor of Lower Moesia, and was also made comes. Lucius selected his ',4),(241,'C','25','favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus, and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force. The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the emperor and general communications and transport. \r\n\r\n',4),(242,'C','26','Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and ',4),(243,'C','27','hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried ',4),(244,'C','28','south to see him. Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days\' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke.\r\nVerus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Vedius Antoninus. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not ',4),(245,'C','29','known how long Verus\' journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.\r\nLucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. He took up a mistress named Panthea, ',4),(246,'C','30','from Smyrna. The biographer calls her a \"low-born girl-friend\", but she is probably closer to Lucian\'s \"woman of perfect beauty\", more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles\' statues. Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the lyre perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit. Panthea read Lucian\'s first draft, and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her—she did not want to become the next Cassiopeia. She had power, too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else.\r\n\r\n',4),(247,'C','31','Critics declaimed Lucius\' luxurious lifestyle. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would \"dice the whole night through\". He enjoyed the company of actors. He made a special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing. He brought a golden statue of the Greens\' horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit. Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius\' bread and circuses to keep them in check.\r\nThis, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the vita dealing with Lucius\' debaucheries is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others ',4),(248,'C','32','take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.\r\nLucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulo\'s arrival one hundred years before. ',4),(249,'C','33','The Syrian army had turned soft during the east\'s long peace. They spent more time at the city\'s open-air cafés than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head ',4),(250,'C','34','of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.\r\nLucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He ',4),(251,'C','35','would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: \"not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy\". Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius\' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius\' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.\r\n\r\n',4),(252,'C','36','Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was ',4),(253,'C','37','completed, the Orontes\' old riverbed dried up, exposing massive bones—the bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast \"more than eleven cubits\" tall; Philostratus says the it was \"thirty cubits\" tall. The oracle at Claros declared that they were the bones of the river\'s spirit.\r\nIn the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus\' daughter Lucilla. Lucilla\'s thirteenth birthday was in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was ',4),(254,'C','38','not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius\' father. Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the the group any official reception. Lucilla would bear three of Fronto\'s children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.\r\nI Minervia and V Macedonica, under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus, served under Statius Priscus in Armenia, earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163, including the capture ',4),(255,'C','39','of the Armenian capital Artaxata. At the end of the year, Verus took the title Armeniacus, despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year. When Lucius was hailed as imperator ',4),(256,'C','40','again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the Imperator II with him. The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina\'s legate Geminius Marcianus.',4),(257,'C','2','Tiridates I was King of Armenia beginning in AD 53 and the founder of the Artaxiad Dynasty. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63. In an agreement to resolve the Roman-Parthian conflict in and over Armenia, Tiridates (who was the brother of Vologases V of Parthia) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor Nero in AD 60; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a client kingdom, various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had de facto ceded Armenia to Parthia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a king, Tiridates was also a Zoroastrian priest and was accompanied by other magi on his journey to Rome in AD 66. In the early 20th century, Franz Cumont speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of Mithraism, which-in Cumont\'s view-was simply Romanized Zoroastrianism. This \"continuity\" theory has since been collectively refuted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTiridates was the brother of Vonones II of Parthia. Virtually nothing is known about his minority and youth, which he spent in Media, where his father was governor under the reign of his brother Gotarzes II. Tiridates\' name meant given by Tir, Tir was an Armeno-Parthian god of literature, science and art based on the Avestan Tishtrya and fused with the Greek Apollo. In 51 the Roman procurator of Cappadocia, Julius Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country, then under an Iberian usurper Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus had killed his uncle Mithridates who was the legitimate king of Armenia by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of Gornea.\r\n\r\n\r\nActing without instruction, Paelignus recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia. Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages; he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia. In 52, King Vologases X (Vagharshak in Armenian) of Parthia took the opportunity and invaded Armenia, conquering Artaxata (Artashat in Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates as king. This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor Augustus and Parthian king Phraates IV which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia. Vologases considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime.A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son Vardanes forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the Parthian prince Tiridates in early 55. Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river Araxes. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy. Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Parasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings. A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given Lesser Armenia (Nicopolis and Satala), Gaius Julius Sohaemus of the house of Emessa received Armenia Sophene. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and Antiochus IV of Commagene attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the Moschoi tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards Tigranocerta through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida (Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault. By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nNero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the Kings of Cappadocia, the grandson of Glaphyra (daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia) and Alexander of Judea (the brother of Herod Archelaus and the son of Herod the Great), who assumed the Armenian name Tigranes (his uncle was Tigranes V). His son, named Alexander, married Iotapa, the daughter of Antiochus IV of Commagene and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country. Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including Polemon, Parasmanes, Aristobolus and Antiochus.\r\n\r\n\r\nVologases was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the Hyrcanians who were revolting. Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene and deposed its King Monobazes in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians. Vologases considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of spahbod Moneses a well-disciplined force of cataphracts along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia. Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the Euphrates and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases in Nisibis located 37 miles (60 km) from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace. Vologases demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the legions of XII Fulminata commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IIII Scythica commanded by Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridates was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Annius Vinicianus to accompany Tiridates to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his family and an imposing retinue, comprised of many feudal lords and 3,000 horsemen. His route lay across Thrace, through Illyria, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and Picenum, in northeastern Italy. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side. The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates.\r\n\r\n\r\nDio Cassius, a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates favorably at the time of his arrival: \"Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence.\" Nero greeted Tiridates at Neapolis (Naples) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. No one was allowed to approach the emperor armed, but Tiridates maintained his dignity by refusing to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). At Puteolis (modern Pozzuoli, near Naples) Nero ordered athletic games to be staged in honor of his guest. The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. The event at Puteolis also marked the first attested appearance of female gladiators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after Tiridates\' arrival, Nero came to the Forum clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the dais, Tiridates knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates addressed the emperor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, I am a descendant of Arsakes and the brother of the Kings [Vologases] and Pacorus. I have come to you who are my god; I have worshipped you as the [sun];] I shall be whatever you would order me to be, because you are my destiny and fortune.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which Nero replied:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person. What your father has not left to you and what your brothers did not preserve for you, I do accord to you, and I make you King of Armenia, so that you, as well as they, may know that I have the power to take away and to grant kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTiridates then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A Praetor, speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek. According to Pliny the Elder, Tiridates then introduced Nero to magian feasts (magicis cenis). Tacitus claimed that Tiridates was also interested in all things Roman.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony. The interior of the Theatre of Pompey and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as \"the Golden Day.\" Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver\'s headdress, took part in a chariot race. At the evening banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with zither accompaniment. Tiridates was amazed and disgusted by Nero\'s extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master. He made no concealment of his views to Nero\'s face and said to him sarcastically: \"Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of Imperator, or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates of fifty million sesterces.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates viewed an exhibition of pancratium. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates saw exclaimed: \"That\'s an unfair contest. It isn\'t fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases, he sent back a dispatch to this effect: \"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the Temple of Janus, which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor; he embellished the royal residence at Garni, nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome.Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero\'s death and through the entire duration of Vespasian\'s rule in the East. Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate dividend of the peace was Rome\'s ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the First Jewish-Roman War just one year after Tiridates\' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible. Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Legio XII Fulminata discovered carved on a mountain in Gobustan (in modern Azerbaijan), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the Caspian Sea in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription. The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor Trajan invaded Armenia in 114.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 72 the Alans, a warlike nomadic Sarmatian tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates and his brother Pacorus, King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a number of battles, during one of which Tiridates was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene. The king of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from Vespasian, who helped reconstruct the fortress of Harmozica around the Iberian capital Mtskheta, near modern Tbilisi. An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates also warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates\' reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor. It is known that Tiridates\' nephew, Axidares, the son of Pacorus II of Parthia, was King of Armenia by 110.\r\n\r\n\r\nTiridates is one of the principal characters in George Frideric Handel\'s Radamisto and Reinhard Keiser\'s Octavia operas.\r\n',1),(258,'C','1','Soon after the emperors\' accession, Marcus\' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle). At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions ',5),(259,'C','2','were made for the support of poor children, along the lines of earlier imperial foundations. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved ',5),(261,'C','3','of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior.

The tutor was immensely ',5),(277,'C','11','proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now ',5),(279,'C','12','perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing ',5),(281,'C','13','corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was ',5),(283,'C','14','hoping for then, I have now.

Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors. Marcus told Fronto of his reading—Coelius and a little Cicero—and his ',5),(289,'C','17','family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-',5),(291,'C','18','aunt Matilda; Marcus thought the evening air of the ',5),(293,'C','19','country was too cold for them.

Marcus was able to give himself wholly to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(295,'C','20','In the spring of 162, the Tiber flooded over its banks, ',5),(297,'C','21','destroying much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(299,'C','22','On his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and ',5),(301,'C','23','the foreign kings who had wronged him. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the ',5),(303,'C','24','Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled ',5),(305,'C','25','its king and installed his own Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself.

The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living ',5),(311,'C','28','in the east had a deleterious effect on his character. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(313,'C','29','The confidence man Alexander of Abonutichus, a prophet ',5),(315,'C','30','who carried a snake named Glycon around with him, had enraptured Severianus, as he had many others.

Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; the city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".\r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(426,'C','67','Furius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was sent with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, M.

Moreover, he was far more qualified than ',5),(435,'C','69','his praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said ',5),(439,'C','70','to owe his office to the influence of Pius\' mistress Galeria Lysistrate. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real ',5),(442,'C','71','access to senatorial circles—his was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the guard, Victorinus was the clear choice. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(446,'C','72','Laelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and governor of Syria in 153; he hence had first-hand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made comes Augustorum (\"companion of ',5),(450,'C','73','the emperors\") for his service. Laelianus was, in the words ',5),(454,'C','74','of Fronto, \"a serious man and an old-fashioned ',5),(458,'C','75','disciplinarian\". Bassus had been governor of Lower ',5),(462,'C','76','Moesia, and was also made comes. Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, Eclectus, and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force. The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the emperor and general communications and transport. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(466,'C','77','Lucius left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua. Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers ',5),(470,'C','78','to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him. Fronto was upset at the news, but was ',5),(474,'C','79','reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil ',5),(478,'C','80','to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days\' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(482,'C','81','Verus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and joined the Eleusinian Mysteries. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Vedius Antoninus. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia ',5),(487,'C','82','Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not known how long Verus\' journey east took; he might not have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(491,'C','83','Lucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. He took up a mistress named Panthea, ',5),(495,'C','84','from Smyrna. The biographer calls her a \"low-born girl-friend\", but she is probably closer to Lucian\'s \"woman of ',5),(499,'C','85','perfect beauty\", more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles\' statues. Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the ',5),(506,'C','86','lyre perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit. Panthea read Lucian\'s first draft, and criticized him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her—she did not want to become the next ',5),(510,'C','87','Cassiopeia. She had power, too. She made Lucius shave ',5),(518,'C','88','his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(522,'C','89','Critics declaimed Lucius\' luxurious lifestyle. He had taken ',5),(526,'C','90','to gambling, they said; he would \"dice the whole night through\". He enjoyed the company of actors. He made a special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him ',5),(530,'C','91','updated on how his chariot teams were doing. He brought a golden statue of the Greens\' horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit. Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius\' bread and circuses to keep them in check.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole section of the vita dealing with Lucius\' debaucheries is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an ',5),(535,'C','92','earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n ',5),(538,'C','93','Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulo\'s arrival one hundred years before. ',5),(543,'C','94','The Syrian army had turned soft during the east\'s long peace. They spent more time at the city\'s open-air cafés ',5),(547,'C','95','than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped ',5),(551,'C','96','of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay. \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(555,'C','97','Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he ',5),(557,'C','98','wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his ',5),(561,'C','99','work: \"not even yet has anything been accomplished such ',5),(565,'C','100','as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy\". \r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(745,'C','T','Lucius Verus was the first born son of Avidia Plautia and Lucius Aelius Caesar. He was the adopted son, and intended successor, of Emperor Hadrian (117-138). \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Aelius Caesar died in 138, Hadrian chose Antoninus Pius (138-161) as his successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt both Verus (then seven years old) and Marcus Aurelius, Hadrian\'s nephew. As an imperial prince, Verus received careful education from the most famous grammaticus Marcus Cornelius Fronto. Verus is reported to have been an excellent student, fond of writing poetry and delivering speeches. \r\n\r\n\r\nVerus had two sisters. One sister Ceionia Fabia was engaged to Marcus Aurelius in 136. However Marcus Aurelius in 138, broke off the engagement to Fabia. Aurelius was adopted by emperor Antoninus Pius\' and was engaged to Antoninus\' daughter Faustina the Younger whom he later married. Lucius had another sister Ceionia Plautia, but little is known about the sisters. \r\n\r\n\r\nVerus\' political career started as quaestor in 153 and then as consul in 154. In 161, he was once again consul, with Marcus Aurelius as senior partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntoninus died on March 7, 161, and was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. Although Marcus shows no personal affection for Hadrian (significantly, he does not thank him in the first book of his Meditations), he presumably believed it his duty to enact the man\'s succession plans. Thus, although the senate planned to confirm Marcus alone, he refused to take office unless Lucius received equal powers. The senate accepted, granting Lucius the imperium, the tribunician power, and the name Augustus. Marcus became, in official titulature, Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus; Lucius, forgoing his name Commodus and taking Marcus\' family name, Verus, became Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus. It was the first time that Rome was ruled by two emperors. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of their nominal equality, Marcus held more auctoritas, or \"authority\", than Verus. He had been consul once more than Lucius, he had shared in Pius\' administration, and he alone was Pontifex Maximus. It would have been clear to the public which emperor was the more senior. As the biographer wrote, \"Verus obeyed Marcus...as a lieutenant obeys a proconsul or a governor obeys the emperor.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after their senate confirmation, the emperors proceeded to the Castra Praetoria, the camp of the praetorian guard. Lucius addressed the assembled troops, which then acclaimed the pair as imperatores. Then, like every new emperor since Claudius, Lucius promised the troops a special donative. This donative, however, was twice the size of those past: 20,000 sesterces (5,000 denarii) per capita, more to officers. In return for this bounty, equivalent to several years\' pay, the troops swore an oath to protect the emperors. The ceremony was perhaps not entirely necessary, given that Marcus\' accession had been peaceful and unopposed, but it was good insurance against later military troubles. \r\n\r\n\r\nPius\' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, \"elaborate\". If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the Campus Martius, while his spirit would rise to the gods\' home in the heavens. Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Pius\' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors\' wishes. A flamen, or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Pius, now Divus Antoninus. Pius\' remains were laid to rest in the Hadrian\'s mausoleum, beside the remains of Marcus\' children and of Hadrian himself. The temple he had dedicated to his wife, Diva Faustina, became the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.\r\n\r\n',6),(746,'C','101','Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius\' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius\' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace. \r\n\r\n\r\nLucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river ',5),(748,'C','102','breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed, the Orontes\' old riverbed dried up, exposing massive bones—the bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast \"more than eleven cubits\" tall; Philostratus says the it was \"thirty cubits\" tall. The oracle ',5),(750,'C','103','at Claros declared that they were the bones of the river\'s spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n',5),(752,'C','104','In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early ',5),(754,'C','105','164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus\' daughter Lucilla. Lucilla\'s thirteenth birthday was ',5),(756,'C','106','in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps ',5),(758,'C','107','stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius\' father. Marcus may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent ',5),(760,'C','108','out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the the group any official reception. Lucilla would bear three of Fronto\'s children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.\r\n\r\n\r\nI Minervia and V Macedonica, under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus, served under Statius Priscus in Armenia, earning success for Roman arms ',5),(762,'C','109','during the campaign season of 163, including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata. At the end of the year, Verus took the title Armeniacus, despite having never seen ',5),(764,'C','110','combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until the following year. When Lucius was hailed as imperator again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the ',5),(766,'C','111','Imperator II with him. The army of Syria was reinforced by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina\'s legate Geminius Marcianus.',5),(767,'C','T','An important development in personality psychology  during the late 20th century was the emergence of a near consensus regarding the structure of personality characteristics. By the late 1990s, most personality researchers had come to agree that the domain of personality variation could be best summarized in terms of five broad and roughly independent dimensions known as the Big Five factors. These dimensions had originally been discovered in investigations of English-language personality-descriptive adjectives and were later popularized via the five-factor model (FFM) of personality structure and its associated questionnaire instruments. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, however, considerable evidence has accumulated in favor of an alternative representation of personality structure. This alternative structure, which we have recently named the HEXACO model, consists of six rather than five dimensions. Three of the six HEXACO factors correspond very closely to dimensions of the B5/FFM, whereas the other three HEXACO factors bear a more complex relation with the remaining two dimensions of the B5/FFM. We should emphasize from the beginning that this alternative structure is not the result of any expansion of the definition of the personality domain, nor is it the result of any changes in the methods used to examine personality structure. Instead, the clearest evidence in favor of the HEXACO representation has emerged from investigations that have employed the same strategy of variable selection and measurement as did the investigations that produced the B5/FFM structure.\r\n\r\nWe argue that the HEXACO model of personality structure provides a viable alternative to the B5/FFM framework. This argument is organized into three sections. First, we summarize lexical studies of personality structure as conducted in various languages and cultures, showing that those investigations consistently yield a structure containing not just five but six factors and that those factors correspond to those of the HEXACO model. Second, we discuss the theoretical interpretability of the HEXACO and B5/FFM structures, noting that the HEXACO model predicts several personality phenomena that are unexplained by the B5/FFM. Third, we review evidence indicating that the HEXACO model accommodates several important personality constructs that are largely beyond the space of the B5/FFM.\r\n',7),(768,'C','1','The problem of identifying the major dimensions of personality is most directly addressed with the use of the statistical technique of factor analysis. However, in order for factor analysis to produce a faithful rendering of personality structure, it is necessary to analyze variable sets that are representative of the ',8),(769,'C','2','personality domain. The method by which researchers have obtained such variable sets is that of the lexical strategy, whereby the familiar personality-descriptive words (generally adjectives) of a language ',8),(771,'C','3','are selected for the purpose of obtaining selfratings or peer ratings that can then be factor analyzed. The lexical approach has the important strength that the selected variables are known to represent the full array of subjectively important personality characteristics, as observed and described by generations ',8),(772,'C','4','of people within a given language community. This approach, therefore, avoids the problem of researcher biases in the selection of personality variables (see Ashton & Lee, 2005a, for responses to various criticisms of the lexical approach).',8),(773,'C','5','Investigations of personality structure based on the lexical approach were first conducted in the English language. In those early studies (e.g., Cattell, 1947), limitations on computing capacity forced researchers to use rather small variable sets, representing only a small fraction of the English personality ',8),(774,'C','6','lexicon. Nevertheless, these investigations consistently produced a common set of five factors (see Norman, 1963; Tupes & Christal, 1961, 1992) that have collectively been named the Big Five (Goldberg, 1981). These dimensions are generally known as Extraversion (e.g., talkative, outgoing vs. quiet, shy),',8),(776,'C','7','Agreeableness (e.g., gentle, sympathetic vs. harsh, cold-hearted), Conscientiousness (e.g., organized, disciplined vs. sloppy, lazy), Emotional Stability (e.g., relaxed vs. moody, anxious), and Intellect/Imagination (e.g., intellectual, imaginative vs. shallow). Although the Big Five factors were ',8),(778,'C','8','derived from lexical research, those dimensions have been operationalized and popularized via personality questionnaires, particularly the NEO Personality Inventory–Revised and the NEO Five-Factor ',8),(780,'C','9','Inventory (NEO-PI-R and NEO-FFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992). These instruments assess the dimensions of the FFM, which conceptualizes the five factors in ways that depart slightly from their original Big Five identities but remains very similar overall to the Big Five structure. (One noteworthy departure is that the FFM Openness to Experience factor excludes characteristics that describe intellectual ability, ',8),(782,'C','10','whereas those characteristics are included within the corresponding Big Five factor of Intellect/Imagination.) As a historical note, it is worth remembering that the FFM owes its origins to lexical studies of personality structure (see McCrae, 1989). Three of the five dimensions—Neuroticism',8),(784,'C','11','(i.e., low Emotional Stability), Extraversion, and Openness to Experience—were identified in analyses of ',8),(786,'C','12','Cattell’s personality scales, which had in turn been derived from Cattell’s (1947) earlier lexical research. ',8),(788,'C','13','The other two dimensions—Agreeableness and Conscientiousness— were added in response to more recent findings in English-language lexical studies of personality structure (e.g., Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981).',8),(796,'C','1','Soon after the emperors\' accession, Marcus\' eleven-year-old daughter, Annia Lucilla, was betrothed to Lucius (in spite of the fact that he was, formally, her uncle). At the ceremonies commemorating the event, new provisions were made for the support of poor children, along the lines ',9),(798,'C','2','of earlier imperial foundations. Marcus and Lucius proved popular with the people of Rome, who strongly approved of their civiliter (\"lacking pomp\") behavior. The emperors ',9),(799,'C','3','permitted  free speech, evinced by the fact that the comedy writer Marullus was able to criticize them without suffering ',9),(800,'C','4','retribution . At any other time, under any other emperor, he would have been executed. But it was a peaceful time, a forgiving time. And thus, as the biographer wrote, \"No one missed the lenient ways of Pius.\"\r\n\r\nFronto returned to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 ',9),(801,'C','5','March , having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils\' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if he could call on the ',9),(803,'C','6','emperors . Fronto would later explain that he had not dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely ',9),(805,'C','7','proud  of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: \"There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing ',9),(807,'C','8','corn ; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality.\" Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to ',9),(809,'C','9','invite  Lucius.\r\n\r\nLucius was less esteemed by his tutor than his brother, as ',9),(812,'C','10','his  interests were on a lower level. Lucius asked Fronto to adjudicate in a dispute he and his friend Calpurnius were having on the relative merits of two actors. Marcus told Fronto of his reading--Coelius and a little Cicero--and his family. His daughters were in Rome, with their great-great-',9),(813,'C','11','aunt  Matilda; Marcus thought the evening air of the country was too cold for them. Marcus\' early reign proceeded smoothly. Marcus was able to give himself ',9),(814,'C','12','wholly  to philosophy and the pursuit of popular affection.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 162, the Tiber flooded over its banks, ',9),(816,'C','13','destroying  much of Rome. It drowned many animals, leaving the city in famine. Marcus and Lucius gave the crisis their personal attention. In other times of famine, the emperors are said to have provided for the Italian communities out of the Roman granaries.\r\n',9),(818,'C','14','On  his deathbed, Pius spoke of nothing but the state and the foreign kings who had wronged him. One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late ',9),(821,'C','15','summer  or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), expelled ',9),(822,'C','16','its  king and installed his own Pacorus, an Arsacid like himself. At the time of the invasion, the governor of Syria was L. Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his ',9),(823,'C','17','replacement . The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living ',9),(825,'C','18','in  the east had a deleterious effect on his character.\r\n\r\nThe confidence man Alexander of Abonutichus, a prophet who carried a snake named Glycon around with him, had ',9),(827,'C','19','enraptured  Severianus, as he had many others. Father-in-law to the respected senator P. Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, then-proconsul of Asia, Abonutichus was friends with many members of the east Roman elite. Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the ',9),(829,'C','20','Parthians  easily, and win glory for himself. Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past ',9),(831,'C','21','the  headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of ',9),(833,'C','22','his  campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.\r\n\r\nThere was threat of war on other frontiers as well--in Britain, and in Raetia and Upper Germany, where the Chatti of the Taunus mountains had recently crossed over ',9),(835,'C','23','the  limes. Marcus was unprepared. Pius seems to have given him no military experience; the biographer writes that Marcus spent the whole of Pius\' twenty-three-year ',9),(837,'C','24','reign  at his emperor\'s side--and not in the provinces, where most previous emperors had spent their early ',9),(839,'C','25','careers . Marcus made the necessary appointments: Marcus Statius Priscus, the governor of Britain, was sent to replace Severianus as governor of Cappadocia. Sextus Calpurnius Agricola would take Priscus\' former office.\r\n\r\nMore bad news arrived: Attidius Cornelianus\' army had ',9),(845,'C','26','been  defeated in battle against the Parthians, and retreated in disarray. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African ',9),(846,'C','27','senator  commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian ',9),(847,'C','28','legions . Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany, II Adiutrix from Aquincum, and V Macedonica from Troesmis. The norther frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible. Attidius Cornelianus ',9),(848,'C','29','himself  was replaced by M. Annius Libo, Marcus\' first cousin. He was young his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties and, as a mere patrician, ',9),(849,'C','30','lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.\r\n\r\n',9),(850,'C','31','Marcus took a four-day public holiday at Alsium, a resort town on the Etrurian coast. He was too anxious to relax. Writing to Fronto, he declared that he would not speak about his holiday. Fronto replied ironically: \"What? Do I not know that you went to Alsium with the intention of ',9),(852,'C','32','devoting yourself to games, joking and complete leisure for four whole days?\" He encouraged Marcus to rest, calling on the example of his predecessors (Pius had enjoyed ',9),(854,'C','33','exercise in the palaestra, fishing, and comedy), going so far as to write up a fable about the gods\' division of the day ',9),(856,'C','34','between morning and evening--Marcus had apparently been spending most of his evenings on judicial matters instead of at leisure. Marcus could not take Fronto\'s advice. \"I have duties hanging over me that can hardly be begged off,\" he wrote back. Marcus put on Fronto\'s voice to ',9),(858,'C','35','chastise himself: \"\'Much good has my advice done you\', you will say!\" He had rested, and would rest often, but \"--this devotion to duty! Who knows better than you how demanding it is!\"\r\n\r\n',9),(860,'C','36','Fronto sent Marcus a selection of reading material, including Cicero\'s pro lege Manilia, in which the orator had argued in favor of Pompey taking supreme command ',9),(862,'C','37','in the Mithridatic War. It was an apt reference (Pompey\'s war had taken him to Armenia), and may have had some impact on the decision to send Lucius to the eastern front. \"You will find in it many chapters aptly suited to your present counsels, concerning the choice of army ',9),(864,'C','38','commanders, the interests of allies, the protection of provinces, the discipline of the soldiers, the qualifications required for commanders in the field and elsewhere.\'\' To',9),(866,'C','39','settle his unease over the course of the Parthian war, Fronto wrote Marcus a long and considered letter, full of ',9),(868,'C','40','historical references. In modern editions of Fronto\'s works, it is labeled De bello Parthico (On the Parthian War). There had been reverses in Rome\'s past, Fronto writes, at Allia, at Caudium, at Cannae, at Numantia, Cirta, and Carrhae; under Trajan, Hadrian, and Pius; but, in the end, Romans ',9),(870,'C','41','had always prevailed over their enemies: \"always and everywhere has changed our troubles into successes and our terrors into triumphs\". \r\n',9),(872,'C','42','Over  the winter of 161-62, as more bad news arrived a rebellion was brewing in Syria it was decided that Lucius should direct the Parthian war in person.

Whatever the case, the senate gave its assent, and Lucius left. Marcus would remain in Rome; ',9),(874,'C','44','the  city \"demanded the presence of an emperor\".\r\n\r\nFurius Victorinus, one of the two praetorian prefects, was ',9),(875,'C','45','sent  with Lucius, as were a pair of senators, M.

Moreover, he was far more qualified than ',9),(876,'C','46','his  praetorian partner, Cornelius Repentinus, who was said to owe his office to the influence of Pius\' mistress Galeria Lysistrate. Repentius had the rank of a senator, but no real ',9),(877,'C','47','access  to senatorial circles--his was merely a decorative title. Since a prefect had to accompany the guard, ',9),(878,'C','48','Victorinus  was the clear choice.\r\n\r\nLaelianus had been governor of both Pannonias and governor of Syria in 153; he hence had first-hand knowledge of the eastern army and military strategy on the frontiers. He was made comes Augustorum (\"companion of ',9),(879,'C','49','the  emperors\") for his service. Laelianus was, in the words of Fronto, \"a serious man and an old-fashioned disciplinarian\". Bassus had been governor of Lower ',9),(880,'C','50','Moesia , and was also made comes. Lucius selected his favorite freedmen, including Geminus, Agaclytus, Coedes, ',9),(881,'C','51','Eclectus , and Nicomedes, who gave up his duties as praefectus vehiculorum to run the commissariat of the expeditionary force. The fleet of Misenum was charged with transporting the emperor and general communications and transport.\r\nLucius  left in the summer of 162 to take a ship from Brundisium; Marcus followed him as far as Capua.

Lucius feasted himself in the country houses along his route, and ',9),(892,'C','53','hunted at Apulia. He fell ill at Canosa, probably afflicted with a mild stroke, and took to bed. Marcus made prayers ',9),(893,'C','54','to the gods for his safety in front of the senate, and hurried south to see him. Fronto was upset at the news, but was reassured when Lucius sent him a letter describing his treatment and recovery. In his reply, Fronto urged his pupil to moderate his desires, and recommended a few days of ',9),(894,'C','55','quiet bedrest. Lucius was better after three days\' fasting and a bloodletting. It was probably only a mild stroke.\r\n\r\nVerus continued eastward via Corinth and Athens, ',9),(895,'C','56','accompanied by musicians and singers as if in a royal progress. At Athens he stayed with Herodes Atticus, and ',9),(896,'C','57','joined the Eleusinian Mysteries. During sacrifice, a falling star was observed in the sky, shooting west to east. He stopped in Ephesus, where he is attested at the estate of the local aristocrat Vedius Antoninus. The journey continued by ship through the Aegean and the southern coasts of Asia ',9),(897,'C','58','Minor, lingering in the famed pleasure resorts of Pamphylia and Cilicia, before arriving in Antioch. It is not known how long Verus\' journey east took; he might not ',9),(898,'C','59','have arrived in Antioch until after 162. Statius Priscus, meanwhile, must have already arrived in Cappadocia; he ',9),(899,'C','60','would earn fame in 163 for successful generalship.\r\nLucius spent most of the campaign in Antioch, though he wintered at Laodicea and summered at Daphne, a resort just outside Antioch. He took up a mistress named Panthea, from Smyrna. The biographer calls her a \"low-born girl-',9),(900,'C','61','friend\", but she is probably closer to Lucian\'s \"woman of perfect beauty\", more beautiful than any of Phidias and Praxiteles\' statues. Polite, caring, humble, she sang to the ',9),(901,'C','62','lyre  perfectly and spoke clear Ionic Greek, spiced with Attic wit. Panthea read Lucian\'s first draft, and criticized ',9),(902,'C','63','him for flattery. He had compared her to a goddess, which frightened her--she did not want to become the next Cassiopeia. She had power, too. She made Lucius shave his beard for her. The Syrians mocked him for this, as they did for much else.\r\n\r\n',9),(903,'C','64','Critics declaimed Lucius\' luxurious lifestyle. He had taken to gambling, they said; he would \"dice the whole night through\". He enjoyed the company of actors. He made a ',9),(904,'C','65','special request for dispatches from Rome, to keep him updated on how his chariot teams were doing. He brought a ',9),(905,'C','66','golden statue of the Greens\' horse Volucer around with him, as a token of his team spirit. Fronto defended his pupil against some of these claims: the Roman people needed Lucius\' bread and circuses to keep them in check.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is how the biographer has it. The whole ',9),(906,'C','67','section of the vita dealing with Lucius\' debaucheries is an insertion into a narrative otherwise entirely cribbed from an earlier source. Some few passages seem genuine; others ',9),(907,'C','68','take and elaborate something from the original. The rest is by the biographer himself, relying on nothing better than his own imagination.\r\n\r\n',9),(909,'C','69','Lucius faced quite a task. Fronto described the scene in terms recalling Corbulo\'s arrival one hundred years before. The Syrian army had turned soft during the east\'s long peace. They spent more time at the city\'s open-air cafés than in their quarters. Under Lucius, training was stepped ',9),(911,'C','70','up. Pontius Laelianus ordered that their saddles be stripped of their padding. Gambling and drinking were sternly policed. Fronto wrote that Lucius was on foot at the head ',9),(913,'C','71','of his army as often as on horseback. He personally inspected soldiers in the field and at camp, including the sick bay.\r\n\r\n',9),(915,'C','72','Lucius sent Fronto few messages at the beginning of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: \"not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to invite you to share in the joy\". ',9),(918,'C','73','Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius\' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius\' ',9),(919,'C','74','presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.\r\n\r\n',9),(920,'C','75','Lucius needed to make extensive imports into Antioch, so he opened a sailing route up the Orontes. Because the river breaks across a cliff before reaching the city, Lucius ordered that a new canal be dug. After the project was completed, the Orontes\' old riverbed dried up, exposing ',9),(922,'C','76','massive bones--the bones of a giant. Pausanias says they were from a beast \"more than eleven cubits\" tall; Philostratus says the it was \"thirty cubits\" tall. The oracle at Claros declared that they were the bones of the river\'s spirit.\r\n\r\n',9),(924,'C','77','In the middle of the war, perhaps in autumn 163 or early 164, Lucius made a trip to Ephesus to be married to Marcus\' daughter Lucilla. Lucilla\'s thirteenth birthday was ',9),(926,'C','78','in March 163; whatever the date of her marriage, she was not yet fifteen. Marcus had moved up the date: perhaps stories of Panthea had disturbed him. Lucilla was accompanied by her mother Faustina and M. Vettulenus Civica Barbarus, the half-brother of Lucius\' father. Marcus ',9),(928,'C','79','may have planned to accompany them all the way to Smyrna (the biographer says he told the senate he would); this did not happen. Marcus only accompanied the group as ',9),(930,'C','80','far as Brundisium, where they boarded a ship for the east. Marcus returned to Rome immediately thereafter, and sent ',9),(932,'C','81','out special instructions to his proconsuls not to give the the group any official reception. Lucilla would bear three of Fronto\'s children in the coming years. Lucilla became Lucilla Augusta.I Minervia and V Macedonica, under the legates M. Claudius Fronto and P. Martius Verus, served ',9),(934,'C','82','under Statius Priscus in Armenia, earning success for Roman arms during the campaign season of 163, including the capture of the Armenian capital Artaxata. At the end of ',9),(936,'C','83','the year, Verus took the title Armeniacus, despite having never seen combat; Marcus declined to accept the title until ',9),(938,'C','84','the following year. When Lucius was hailed as imperator again, however, Marcus did not hesitate to take the Imperator II with him. The army of Syria was reinforced ',9),(940,'C','85','by II Adiutrix and Danubian legions under X Gemina\'s legate Geminius Marcianus.',9),(953,'C','1','Tiridates I was King of Armenia beginning in AD 53 and the founder of the Artaxiad Dynasty. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63. In an agreement to resolve the Roman-Parthian conflict in and over Armenia, Tiridates (who was the brother of Vologases V of Parthia) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor Nero in AD 60; in the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval ',10),(954,'C','2','from the Romans. Even though this made Armenia a client kingdom, various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had de facto ceded Armenia to Parthia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a king, Tiridates was also a Zoroastrian priest and was accompanied by other magi on his journey to Rome in AD 66. In the early 20th century, Franz ',10),(956,'C','3','Cumont speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of Mithraism, which--in Cumont\'s view--was simply Romanized Zoroastrianism. This \"continuity\" theory has since been collectively refuted.  \r\n\r\n',10),(958,'C','4','Tiridates was the brother of Vonones II of Parthia.  Virtually nothing is known about his minority and youth, which he spent in Media, where his father was governor under the reign of his brother Gotarzes II. Tiridates\' name meant given by Tir, Tir was an Armeno-Parthian god of literature, science and art based on the Avestan Tishtrya and fused with the Greek Apollo. In 51 the Roman procurator of Cappadocia, Julius Paelignus, invaded Armenia and ravaged the country, then under an Iberian usurper Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus had killed his uncle ',10),(960,'C','5','Mithridates who was the legitimate king of Armenia by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of Gornea. \r\n\r\n\r\nActing without instruction, Paelignus recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia. Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion ',10),(966,'C','6','to repair these outrages; he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia. In 52, King Vologases X (Vagharshak in Armenian) of Parthia took the opportunity and invaded Armenia, conquering Artaxata (Artashat in ',10),(968,'C','7','Armenia) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates as king. This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor Augustus and Parthian king Phraates IV which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia. Vologases considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors, now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime.A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son Vardanes forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia, allowing Rhadamistus ',10),(970,'C','8','to come back and punish locals as traitors; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the Parthian prince Tiridates in early 55. Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant. Unable to continue fleeing, she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured. Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger ',10),(972,'C','9','and flung her body into the river Araxes. Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy. Rhadamistus himself ',10),(973,'C','10','returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Parasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings. A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given Lesser Armenia (Nicopolis and Satala), Gaius Julius Sohaemus of the house of Emessa received Armenia Sophene. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from ',10),(974,'C','11','Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north, and Antiochus IV of Commagene attacked from the southwest. Supported by his brother, Tiridates sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide. Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the Moschoi tribes who raided ',10),(975,'C','12','outlying regions of Armenia. Tiridates fled from the capital, and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground. In the summer, Corbulo began moving towards Tigranocerta through rough terrain and passing through the Taronitida ',10),(976,'C','13','(Taron), where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance; however, the city opened its doors, with the exception of one of the citadels, which was destroyed in the ensuing assault. By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome. \r\n\r\n\r\nNero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the Kings of Cappadocia, the grandson of Glaphyra (daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia) and Alexander of Judea (the brother of Herod Archelaus and the son of Herod the ',10),(977,'C','14','Great), who assumed the Armenian name Tigranes (his uncle was Tigranes V). His son, named Alexander, married Iotapa, the daughter of Antiochus IV of Commagene and was made King of Cilicia. Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. A guard of 1000 legionary ',10),(978,'C','15','soldiers, three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country. Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including Polemon, Parasmanes, ',10),(979,'C','16','Aristobolus and Antiochus. \r\n\r\n\r\nVologases was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the Hyrcanians who were revolting. Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene and deposed its King Monobazes in 61, who was a vassal of Parthians. Vologases considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates to the Armenian throne. He placed under the command of spahbod Moneses a well-disciplined force of ',10),(980,'C','17','cataphracts along with Adiabenian auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia. Having quelled the Hyrcanian revolt, Vologases gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia. Corbulo, having been informed of the impending attack, sent two legions under the commands of Verulanus Severus and ',10),(981,'C','18','Vettius Bolanus to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour. He also dispatched a message to Nero, urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of ',10),(982,'C','19','defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril. Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the Euphrates and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces. Since the region was deficient in water, he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them. \r\n\r\n\r\nMoneses marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege. Corbulo, although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation. He sent ',10),(983,'C','20','a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases in Nisibis located 37 miles (60 km) from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege. Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a ',10),(984,'C','21','firm peace. Vologases demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia, that Tigranes should be dethroned, and that the position of Tiridates be recognized. The Roman government declined to accede to ',10),(985,'C','22','these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus, governor of Cappadocia, to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration. \r\n\r\n\r\nPaetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the legions of XII Fulminata commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IIII Scythica commanded by Funisulanus Vettonianus. The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo, who the following year led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia, eliminating all of the ',10),(986,'C','23','regional governors he suspected were pro-Parthian. Finally in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates met to make a peace agreement. The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates and Corbulo. It appealed to Tiridates because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; on the other hand, it appealed to Corbulo ',10),(987,'C','24','because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location. When Tiridates arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero, agreeing to receive it ',10),(988,'C','25','back only from Nero in Rome. Tiridates was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently, in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed. Corbulo left his son-in-law Annius Vinicianus to accompany Tiridates to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to embarking for Rome, Tiridates visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia. On his long trek he was accompanied by his family and an imposing retinue, comprised of many feudal lords and ',10),(989,'C','26','3,000 horsemen. His route lay across Thrace, through Illyria, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and Picenum, in northeastern Italy. The journey took nine months, and Tiridates rode on horseback, with his children and queen at his side. The children of Vologases, Monobazes and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates. \r\n\r\n',10),(990,'C','27','Dio Cassius, a second-century Roman historian, described Tiridates favorably at the time of his arrival: \"Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life, a notable figure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence.\" Nero ',10),(991,'C','28','greeted Tiridates at Neapolis (Naples) in October, sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles. No one was allowed to approach the emperor armed, but Tiridates maintained his dignity by refusing to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire (though as a compromise, he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath, so that it could not be drawn). At Puteolis (modern Pozzuoli, near Naples) Nero ordered athletic games to be staged in honor of his guest. The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ',10),(992,'C','29','ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes. The event at Puteolis also marked the first attested appearance of female gladiators. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital. Rome was profusely decorated with flags, torches, garlands and bunting, and was gorgeously illuminated at night with ',10),(993,'C','30','great crowds of people seen everywhere.\r\n\r\n \r\nOn the day after Tiridates\' arrival, Nero came to the Forum clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers, all resplendent in expensive attire ',10),(994,'C','31','and glittering armor. While Nero sat on the imperial throne, Tiridates and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers. Arriving in front of the dais, Tiridates knelt, with hands clasped on his breast. After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided, Tiridates addressed the emperor: \r\n\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, I am a descendant of Arsakes and the brother of the Kings [Vologases] and Pacorus. I have come to you who are my god; I have worshipped you as the [sun]; I shall be whatever you would order me to be, ',10),(995,'C','32','because you are my destiny and fortune. \"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which Nero replied: \r\n\r\n\r\nYou have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person. What your father has not left to you and what your brothers did not preserve for you, I do accord to you, and I make you King of Armenia, so that you, as well as ',10),(996,'C','33','they, may know that I have the power to take away and to grant kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTiridates then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt, while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head. As the ',10),(997,'C','34','young king was about to kneel a second time, Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him, made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own. Meanwhile, the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers. A Praetor, speaking to the audience, interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates, who spoke in Greek. According to Pliny the Elder, Tiridates then introduced Nero to magian feasts (magicis cenis). Tacitus claimed that Tiridates was also interested in all things Roman. \r\n\r\n\r\nPublic festivities continued for some time after the ',10),(998,'C','35','coronation ceremony. The interior of the Theatre of Pompey and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion; for this reason, Rome thenceforth recalled that date as \"the Golden Day.\" Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night: Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun. Nero, clad in green and wearing a chariot driver\'s headdress, took part in a chariot race. At the evening ',10),(999,'C','36','banquets, Nero, in gold-embroidered vestments, sang and played the lyre with zither accompaniment. Tiridates was amazed and disgusted by Nero\'s extravagance, but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his ',10),(1000,'C','37','surprise at his serving such a master. He made no concealment of his views to Nero\'s face and said to him sarcastically: \"Sire, you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nIn memory of these events, the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of Imperator, or commander-in-chief of the armies. No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome. Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities, the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates ',10),(1001,'C','38','and his retinue, both from and to their homeland. Nero also made a gift to Tiridates of fifty million sesterces. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn his journey back to Armenia, Tiridates viewed an exhibition of pancratium. When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents, Tiridates saw exclaimed: \"That\'s an unfair ',10),(1002,'C','39','contest. It isn\'t fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nLater, Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases to Rome several times, but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases, he sent back a dispatch to this ',10),(1003,'C','40','effect: \"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange to meet each other.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nPeace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire. Nero therefore closed the gates of the Temple of Janus, which were never shut save in times of universal peace. When Tiridates returned to Armenia, he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata. He renamed the capital Neronia in honor of the emperor; he embellished the royal residence at Garni, ',10),(1004,'C','41','nearby, with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple. Trade between the two continents also grew, allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome.Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally, even after Nero\'s death and through the entire duration of Vespasian\'s rule in the East. ',10),(1005,'C','42','Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate dividend of the peace was Rome\'s ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea, which broke into open warfare culminating in the First ',10),(1006,'C','43','Jewish-Roman War just one year after Tiridates\' coronation. Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria, which would otherwise have been impossible. Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians. The name of Legio XII Fulminata discovered carved on a mountain in Gobustan (in modern Azerbaijan), attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the Caspian Sea in 89 AD, farther east than any previously known Roman inscription. The peace between Parthia and ',10),(1007,'C','44','Rome lasted 50 years, until emperor Trajan invaded Armenia in 114. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 72 the Alans, a warlike nomadic Sarmatian tribe, made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia. Tiridates and his brother Pacorus, King of Media Atropatene, faced them at a ',10),(1008,'C','45','number of battles, during one of which Tiridates was briefly captured, narrowly escaping being taken alive. He was lassoed from a distance and caught, but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time. ',10),(1009,'C','46','The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene. The king of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from Vespasian, who helped reconstruct the fortress of Harmozica around the Iberian capital Mtskheta, near modern Tbilisi. An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates also ',10),(1010,'C','47','warred with Iberia during his final years. The exact date of the end of Tiridates\' reign is unknown; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor. It is known that Tiridates\' nephew, Axidares, the son of Pacorus II of ',10),(1011,'C','48','Parthia, was King of Armenia by 110. \r\n\r\n\r\nTiridates is one of the principal characters in George Frideric Handel\'s Radamisto and Reinhard Keiser\'s Octavia operas.
